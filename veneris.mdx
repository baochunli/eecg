### Biography

Andreas Veneris received a Diploma in Computer Engineering and Informatics from the University of Patras in 1991, the M.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles in 1992 and the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1998. In 1998-99 he was a visiting faculty at the University of Illinois until he joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto in 1999. Since 2011, he is a Professor cross-appointed with The Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. His research interests include formal methods and CAD tools for debug, verification, synthesis and test of digital systems and circuits. In 2011 he was a fellow of the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science hosted by the University of Tokyo. In 2020-21 he was commissioned by the Bank of Canada to co-author a technical, legal and economic report on Canada's candidate digital currency. His work in 2021-22 was also acknowledged for his contributions to a classified report by the Hoover Institution prefaced by former US Secretary of the State Condoleezza Rice and co-authored by an extensive list of prominent world-thinkers that was titled ``Digital Currencies: The US, China, And The World At A Crossroads''.
